\begin{acknowledgements}

I can't begin to count how many times I've been told that \enquote{it takes a special kind of crazy to undertake a Ph.D.}  over the last few years.
While more than a few of those have been me talking to myself in the dark night of the soul, most have been my family, friends, loved ones, and all those others concerned about me during grad school.
A dissertation represents the achievement of multiple years of  nearly all-consuming work, with a fixed view towards a singular goal and one Very Imposing Deadline. 
However, while this cover bears only my name, it truly has been the result of a group effort on multiple levels.
A short page or two at the start of this stack of paper feels like poor recompense for the efforts of all those who, without their many contributions, none of this would have been possible.
Even still, I'll undertake this fool's errand, and do my best to acknowledge all of the countless folks to whom I owe a debt beyond accounting.
In many and various ways, you have all been sources of friendship and love, support and adventures, counsel and harbor over the years.
This is all dedicated to all of you  who kept me going whenever I wanted to give up.



First and foremost, I owe an impossible debt of gratitude to my parents, for all of their unshakable love, unwavering support, and the sacrifices they made along the way. 
You both have always been there for me all of my life, and I wouldn't have been able to get to this point without you.
You will always be my first, and best friends, and a constant bastion of love and support to whom I can turn.
To my siblings Courtney and Jonathan, you have both always made home feel like home, and I can't begin to say how proud I've been to watch you both grow into your own over the years.
You've constantly challenged me to improve myself, and I can't wait to see your lives take off into your own adventures.





Thanks to all of those who shaped my early education, inspired in me a love for the sciences and technical arts, and put me onto this track.
Ann Tucei, Anita Schmitt, and Cherie Crisco all nurtured this early passion, and Jim Bobbitt and the International Baccalaureate program at Pensacola High School helped fan these nascent flames.
Thanks to the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Utah, who fueled the fire, and gave me the early toolkit to prepare for what came next.
In particular, much what I've done here at Berkeley is thanks to Haori Yang, Dong-Ok Choe, and (especially) Tony Butterfield, all of whom went above and beyond in helping guide me to grad school.
This is particularly true for Tony --- in many ways, anything that follows from here is in part your fault!
So, you know, no need to feel (too) guilty about that.
Finally, thanks to everyone in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at UC Berkeley for supporting me in my time here --- you've really made this place feel like home!


A tremendous round of gratitude goes out to all of the Away Teams who've supported me in the many phases of this adventure. 
Listing every single one of you would be impossible, but you are all dearly beloved for everything you've done for me.

In Pensacola, thanks to my dear friends Charles Mudge and Lindsey Lambert (soon-to-be-Mudge), Lucas Bihary, Josh Schulz, Brittanie Esty, Sybil Watson, Bob and Cyndi Myers, Mary Beth Morton, Judi Pemberton,    and all the rest of my Florida family.


In Utah, thanks to Mike Hansen, Kayla Kilpatrick, Afsheen Banisadr, Gaby and Brandon Beaujeu, Courtney Gwinn, Dave Gitlin, Andrew May, Nate King, and all of my Utah family who cared for me in my time there.
A massive debt of thanks goes out in particular to my dear friend Taylor Webb, for years of friendship and ongoing education in the cultivation of yeast and the finer points of an ostentatious life.


In Berkeley, a massive round of thanks goes out to my fellow grad students who have become some of my closest friends:   Maria Simanovskaia, Sami Lewis, Mauricio Unzueta, Bella Urdinaran, Daniel Wooten, Andrew Greenop,  Milos Atz, Austin Lo, Cory Waltz, Joey Kabel, Chris Poresky, Eric Matthews, Amanda Lewis, Jon Morrell, Leo Kirsch, Josh and Christie Rehak, James Kendrick, James Bevins, Kathy Shield, Mitch Negus, Jeff Kwarsick, and Vetri Velan.
Outside of campus, thanks to all of the many other friends I've been blessed with out here: Carlos and Liz Arteta, George and Maren Alexandrov, Sasha and Aaron Asghari,  Nick Bricker, Ruben Brunk, Victor Negut, Chun Ho Chow, Elie Katzenson, Mike Chapman, and too many others.
My deepest gratitude goes out to Joey Curtis and Grace Gordon, for having been such incredible friends to me, and a constant source of support during the times where things get a bit too overwhelming --- you two are just the best. 
You have all been amazing friends and an incredible foster family to me in my time here. 


A big round of thanks is due to all of the staff and scientists at the 88-Inch Cyclotron, including Bethany Goldblum and Darren Bleuel.
You have all provided many thought-provoking discussions, sage advice, and much-needed coffee during the last few years.
A major debt is due to Brien Ninemire   and all of the Operations staff, who worked through many nights and many more days to provide me with the beams that enabled so much of my work.
Likewise, thanks to Michael Gallegos and Don Dry in the LANL C-NR Countroom, David Reass and Mike Connors at LANSCE-IPF, and the LANSCE Accelerator Operations staff for providing beam during my time in Los Alamos.
A dear round of thanks is owed to all of the LANL Isotope Production Facility group, who took me under their wing, and taught me so much during all of my interactions with them: Meiring Nortier, Eva Birnbaum, Michael Fassbender, and  Etienne Vermeulen.
You folks are all Good People, and I hope to keep working with you over the years.



While I've only gotten to know you all more recently, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of the incredible people in the Oslo group: Sunniva Siem, Andreas G{\"o}rgen, Gjermund Henriksen, Bent  Schoultz, Ann-Cecilie Larsen, Magne Guttormsen, Therese Renstr{\o}m, Eda Sahin, Frank Bello Garrote, Lucia Crespo Campo, Vetle Ingeberg, Fabio Zeiser, Gry Tveten, Sunniva Rose, Jan Christian M{\"u}ller, Ina Kullman, Kristine Beckmann, Dorthea Gjestvang, Line Pedersen, Wanja Paulsen, Hannah Berg,  Frida Furmyr, and all those others who have shown me kindness and friendship in my time there.
Here's hoping to many more years of that friendship yet to come!
Particular thanks here are also due to Susanne Mes{\o}y for helping so much to acclimate to Oslo.
Finally, my dearest thanks to  the incredible J{\o}rgen Midtb{\o} and Janne Nyg{\aa}rd for taken me on so many adventures in Oslo, helping make it feel like a home, and being just some of the kindest people I've been blessed to know. 



In my many moves during my lifetime, thanks are especially due to Walter Steele, Randy Blankschaen, and Peter Ledic for the years of spiritual care for my soul.

A huge debt is also owed to Anthony Ehrlich, Tom,  Matt, Mori, Riza, and all the rest of my DnD/SG community over the years, for many evenings spent hunting down mindflayers, slaying dragons, feeding Toby, and killing more than a few aliens.
You all have been great friends when I needed a much needed-break over the years.




Thanks are also due for the funding which helped to support my work and travel over the years. 
This  includes  the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science via the Isotope Development and Production for Research and Applications sub-program in the Office of Nuclear Physics,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,   the U.S. Nuclear Data Program, and  the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



The members of my committee --- Rebecca Abergel, Joseph Cerny, and Karl van Bibber --- have been incredibly generous with their time and expertise. I thank them for their service and guidance.


I owe a massive debt in particular to Jonathan Engle, who truly went out of his way to help pull me into the art of the isotope production game.
Weeks of mentoring, advice for my own professional development, invitations to workshops and experiments, setting up connections for me, and even ski trips  ---  Jon has been a mentor and colleague without equal.
He has been a constant source of guidance and advice in my own research, and none of the work I have performed would likely have been possible without his influence. 
Saying that working with Jon has been a privilege would likely qualify as the understatement of the century.  
I can only hope that I might be able to provide to someone in my own career half of the influence that Jon has shown me.
Much of this holds true for Stephen Graves as well, who was essential in showing me the ropes for much of the analysis in my work.
I have massive respect for both of these gentlemen, and I hope to be able to continue working with you both in the future.





Finally, almost no one here deserves more thanks than my advisor, Lee Bernstein.
Lee took me under his wing almost immediately upon my arrival in Berkeley, and I haven't looked back since.
Working with Lee has been nothing short of astonishing. 
His passion for teaching and science is truly infectious to those around him, constantly revealing the innate beauty in physics and all things,  which has truly been a pleasure to work with.
Lee has been  a constant source of support, encouragement, philosophy, and guidance in all things, both academic and personal.
He has been a perpetual advocate, tirelessly working to help support me and foster my own development.
It has been breathtaking to watch our humble research group blossom over the last few years to where it is now, and the ride, while often feeling  like hurtling along at light-speed, has been a blast.
He has allowed to take part in countless workshops, conferences, and  experiments, and has introduced me to nearly my entire professional network in the process.
This especially holds true for setting me up with an introduction with the Oslo group, whom I hope to work closely with in the coming years. 
Working with Lee has been nothing short of an honor and a privilege, and leaving him will be one of the hardest parts of leaving Berkeley.
Lee has been a stellar mentor, colleague, and friend, and absolutely none of this with have been possible were it not for him.
Out of all the many blessings I've had, likely none of them  quite compare to Lee having  taken a chance by taking me on as his Ph.D. student.





In closing, all of these people have been the giants upon whose shoulders I've been supported, and I owe each and every one of you a debt that can never be repaid.
You have allowed me to reach this point in my life, and for that, I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
