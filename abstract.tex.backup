The future of nuclear medicine would appear to be the paradigm of personalized medicine --- targeted radionuclide therapy to spare healthy tissue, and theranostic medicine, which pairs an imaging isotope with a therapeutic isotope to provide simultaneous, real-time dose delivery and verification, leading to drastic reductions in prescribed patient dose.
Candidate isotopes to meet these needs have been identified based on their chemical and radioactive decay properties. 
As part this dissertation, I have lead a series of  targeted, high-priority measurements of thin-target cross section, as part of a larger campaign to address deficiencies in cross-cutting nuclear data needs. 
These studies will serve to facilitate the production of pre-clinical quantities of radioactivity for emerging and novel medical radionuclides. 

This dissertation details a series of three  experiments, focusing on production pathways for the radionuclides \ce{^{90}Mo}, \ce{^{51}Mn}, \ce{^{52m}Mn}, \ce{^{52g}Mn}, \ce{^{64}Cu}, and \ce{^{47}Sc}.
Each of these experiments has been designed as part of efforts to measure production cross sections for emerging medical radionuclides and develop new methods for the monitoring of charged-particle beams.
