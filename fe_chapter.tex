\section{Additional discussion}


Additional discussion of the experimental and analytical details for this work, which will be excluded from the published journal article to preserve its scope, are included here.

\subsubsection{88-Inch Cyclotron overview}


As discussed in \autoref{sec:experiment}, the target stack for this work was assembled and irradiated at the Isotope Production Facility (IPF) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), using the LANSCE linear accelerator. 
The LANSCE complex, constructed in 1972, is a large facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Technical Area 53, housing many basic and applied science facilities supported by the LANSCE-LINAC linear accelerator \cite{Lisowski2006}.
The accelerator has proton injector ion sources capable of supplying both positive- and negative-ion beams.
The ions are accelerated up to 750\,keV, where they are injected into a drift-tube linear accelerator.
This accelerator, which operates as a standing-wave linear accelerator in the \enquote{zero mode} (or TM$_{010}$) electromagnetic field configuration, accelerates the ions up to 100\,MeV.  
From here, the negative-ion beam is injected into the side-coupled cavity linear accelerator (800\,m in length), which accelerates the ions up to the facility's maximum 800\,MeV.
This beam is passed along to the various research centers at the LANSCE complex, which include the Lujan Center, Proton Radiography Center, Ultracold Neutron Source, and the Weapons Neutrons Research Facility.
Alternatively, the 100\,MeV positive-ion beam may be \enquote{peeled off} following acceleration in the drift-tube linac, where it is diverted to the Isotope Production Facility.
At IPF, thick production targets and thin-target stacks may be lowered through a dedicated hot cell into the IPF beamline for irradiation.
This facility serves to produce a variety of commercial isotopes for  medical, industrial, basic science, and national security applications.
A schematic of the LANSCE beamline is presented in \autoref{fig:ipf_beamline_schematic}, and a photograph of the LANSCE complex is seen in \autoref{fig:ipf_beamline_alternate}.

% The stack was irradiated for approximately 2 hours with a nominal current of 1 mA, using a 50 \mmicro s pulse at a frequency of 2 Hz, for an anticipated integral current of 205.9 nAh.

\subsubsection{Beam profile measurements}

\textred{Verify that we used polyethylene!!!}


Following  tuning of the 100\,MeV proton beam into the IPF beamline, the current is measured immediately upstream of the target position using a pair of nondestructive inductive pickups.
The final remaining step prior to loading the  target box for irradiation is to tune the beam optics and spatial profile.
This is performed by loading a sheet of polyethylene (approximately 3\,mm thick) into the the IPF beamline, at the same location of the target box's beam entrance window. 
This sheet acts as a beam profile monitor, and is irradiated with 5 \mmicro A-min of the proton beam.
Following exposure, the polyethylene monitor is withdrawn back into the IPF hot cell, where it is inspected to verify the shape and location of the beam profile.
These beam profile irradiations leave an annealable discoloration of the beam profile, which resembles a \enquote{burn mark}, and are observed to passively revert within 1--2 weeks.
The final pre-irradiation beam spot from the Nb(p.x) measurement is seen in  \autoref{fig:ipf_preexp_beam_spot}.
LANSCE accelerator operations staff use this feedback to fine-tune the beam, centering the beam spot upon the target stack and focusing it to ensure that it underfills the target foils.
This process of  optics tuning via polyethylene profile monitors is repeated until an acceptable beam profile is attained.
At this point, the target box is lowered into the beamline, and the irradiation commences.

This polyethylene beam profile monitor is useful for determining the beam profile incident upon the stack's beam entrance window.
However, the beam broadens as it traverses the target stack, with large-angle deflections (primarily in the aluminum degraders) from scattering of the beam.
To image the actual beam profile incident upon the first foil in the stack (Al-1), a 316 stainless steel foil (SS-6) is inserted upstream of Al-1 to serve as a beam profile monitor for the activation foils.
Likewise, another stainless steel profile monitor (SS-1) is inserted downstream of the last foil in the stack (Nb-6).
These stainless steel monitors are cut to the same length and width as the plastic frames used for mounting foils, and are characterized in \autoref{tab:stack_table}.



% \textred{Update the type of film used at IPF, here and in the paper!!!}


As described in \autoref{sec:target_design}, decay radiation emitted from the activated stainless steel foils were used to develop radiochromic film (Gafchromic EBT), revealing the spatial profile of the beam entering and exiting the stack.
Radiochromic films, such as Gafchromic EBT, come in multiple varieties, depending on the   dose range and the type of ionizing radiation desired to provide sensitivity to. 
In general, such films are commonly self-developing, containing a radiation-sensitive organic polymer dye as the active layer.
This dye, much like the polyethylene beam profile monitors, is damaged by ionizing radiation, with multiple free radicals initiated in the process.
These free radicals result in cross-linking, breaking of double bonds, and fragmentation of the dye polymer, which causes the damaged dye to undergo a large visible change in  color.
The intensity of this color change is often proportional to the dose received by the film, and is preferred to be energy-independent \cite{Azam1998}.
Many such films are sensitive to prolonged UV exposure, and will slowly develop if not kept in a  cool, dark environment, leading to systematic errors in observed dose.
The thin dye layer in most films is extremely sensitive, so care must be taken to avoid bending or deforming, which can make them insensitive to development when irradiated.
% Following exposure, the film may be scanned 
For reference, the Gafchromic EBT film used in this work is comprised of a pair of 25\,\mmicro m active layers containing the radiation-sensitive EBT emulsion dye, separated by a 3\,\mmicro m surface layer and sandwiched in between a pair of 97\,\mmicro m layers of clear polyester, acting as a supportive and protective backing. 






%  Move these first two commented sentences into PhD thesis.

% An accurate integrated proton current is one of the most important factors in performing high-fidelity cross section measurements.
% At the time of this work, the nondestructive beam current monitors in the LANSCE-IPF beamline had a  resolution of 100 nAh.
% For a low-current irradiation such as this work, where a nominal fluence of 200 nAh is desired, additional fluence sensitivity is thus needed to accurately normalize quantified EoB activities into cross sections.


The radiochromic films developed by the SS-6 and SS-1 stainless steel beam profile monitors are seen in \autoref{fig:gafchromic_nb}.
In addition, extra aluminum monitor foils mounted on  plastic frames are superimposed behind each film.
It is clear from the upstream (SS-6) film that the proton beam profile was consistent with that seen in the final pre-irradiation beam spot check of  \autoref{fig:ipf_preexp_beam_spot}.
The downstream (SS-1) film  reveals that the beam was not completely attenuated,  
% in the target stack
and clearly displays the  broadening expected due to scattering in the target stack. 
More importantly, the beam profiles in both films appears to be completely contained within the 25$\times$25\,mm activation foils, including the beam envelope.
If the beam were to be misaligned on the foils, or were to have sufficiently broadened such that it greatly overfilled the foils, the activation foils would be exposed to only a fraction of the total beam current.
If  fluence measurements are purely taken from an external  current monitor (such as an inductive pickup upstream of a target, or an electrically-isolated target in a Faraday cup), the  fraction of current which misses the foils will not be detected.
This leads to reporting a false, larger  fluence, which will cause all cross sections to be erroneously reported with a reduced magnitude.
Thus, it is for this  reason that having monitor foils at each energy position builds confidence in reported cross sections, as they serve to screen for systematic errors such as this.
However, profile monitors play a vital role in the detection of lost beam fluence when monitor foils are unavailable. 
% Additionally, 







Since the color change developed by irradiation is proportional to the dose deposited in the film, the optical density of the film may be used to measure dose.
In clinical external-beam radiation therapy, these films are commonly used in quality assurance  to map and verify  the dose contours for therapeutic gamma-ray fields.
However, the dose sensitivity of these films is often greater than the ability to be visually distinguished beyond simple qualitative inspection.
As a result, following exposure, the film may be digitized using any flatbed scanner.
Image analysis may be thus used to measure the optical density profile as a surrogate for dose or beam intensity profiles.
The optical density is often fit to a curve of the form
\begin{equation}
d_x\pp{D} = a + \dfrac{b}{D-c}
\end{equation}
where $d_x\pp{D}$ is the optical density of exposed radiochromic film in scanner color channel $x$ at dose $D$, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are calibration parameters.
Using a standard irradiation source (commonly a collimated \ce{^{60}Co} source), a calibration curve can thus be measured to convert optical density into an absolute dose.
This is most common in clinical and quality assurance applications.
In addition, modern radiochromic films are often designed such that the characteristic exposure curve for the active layer dye differs between the red, green, and blue color channels, offering even further enhanced sensitivity to dose \cite{bushberg2011essential,Andre2011,David2012}.





However, for cases where an absolute dose is not necessary, the optical density can still be used for a qualitative measure of relative beam intensity, or relative dose.
Using the image analysis code  ImageJ-2.0.0,  profiles of the total optical density were extracted for both the SS-1 and SS-6 radiochromic films \cite{Rueden2017}.
These are seen in \autoref{fig:gafchromic_nb_profiles}, as relative beam intensity profiles along the major and minor axis of each film.
As seen visually, for both axes, the peak beam intensity drops from SS-6 to SS-1, as the proton fluence is clearly broadened by scattering reactions in the target stack.
% As seen visually, there is a clear broadening of the beam spot in the rear of the target stack.
Along the major (\enquote{horizontal}) axis, the FWHM of the beam profile broadens from 0.679\,cm to 1.039\,cm, and along the minor (\enquote{vertical}) axis, the FWHM of the beam profile broadens from 0.453\,cm to 0.902\,cm.
In addition, the centroid position of the minor axis appears to shift by approximately 0.19\,cm between the front and rear of the stack. 
The measured beam profiles were fit using a Gaussian model with linear background, to aid in comparing the widths of each profile.
The Gaussian model does well to fit the beam profiles overall, though it overestimates the peak height for a given Gaussian width.
This is likely due to the fact that the beam itself has an intrinsic spatial width before any interactions with the target stack; this leads to more broadening of the beam envelope than of its core.

\subsubsection{Target preparation}

As described in \autoref{sec:target_design}, all activation  foils in this work were   tightly sealed into \enquote{packets} using two pieces of  3M 5413-Series Kapton polyimide film tape.
The sealed foils were then mounted over the hollow center of a 1.575 mm-thick plastic frame.
This gives each foil a fixed, rigid, position, preventing it from shifting out of alignment as the target stack is lowered into the beamline.
In addition, the hollow center is cut out such that the plastic frame does not degrade and scatter the beam at each foil position.
% to minimize the 
One \ce{^{nat}Al}, one \ce{^{nat}Cu}, and one \ce{^{nat}Nb} mounted foil were bundled together using baling wire for each energy position.
One such bundle is seen in \autoref{fig:IMG_1969}, illustrating how the three foils of each bundle are aligned with each other.
This is primarily to maintain a comparable area of exposed foil at each energy position, in the case of significant beam spot broadening
These foil packet bundles were lowered into the beamline by inserting them into a  water-cooled production target box.
After sealing the target box, it is inserted into the IPF hot cell, seen in \autoref{fig:IMG_1984}. 
In the hot cell, robotic manipulators are used to attach a mounting frame to the top of the target box.
The frame is used to mount the target box onto a motorized track, which extends  below the hot cell, and is used to lower the target box by approximately 12\,m into its position in the IPF beamline.
Following irradiation, the track raises the target box back into the hot cell, where it is detached and opened via manipulators.
Foil removal is performed in the hot cell via the manipulators, as the target box becomes highly activated with short-lived Al activation products, which makes manual handling hazardous.
The foil bundles are removed using the baling wire loop \enquote{handles}, and  removed from the hot cell via a pass-through, for decontamination and transfer to the counting lab.

\subsubsection{MCNP modeling}




A rendering of the IPF Nb(p,x) target stack, as modeled in MCNP6, is seen in \autoref{fig:ipf_vised}.
% This figure presents a small subset of the full MCNP6 model of the HFNG,  to better illustrate the geometry of the target chamber.
This model is the same described in \autoref{sec:proton_transport} for simulation of proton transport.
The full input file for this MCNP model is included here for reference, in Appendix \ref{sec:ipf_mcnp_deck}.
In this figure, the 100\,MeV proton beam enters from the left of the figure, where it is incident (in the positive $x$ direction) upon the Inconel beam entrance window (yellow).
The other stack elements, described in  \autoref{tab:stack_table} are illustrated here, as well.
The green cell is the cooling water channel for the target box, the air filling the target box is shown in light blue, and the 6061 aluminum beam degraders are shown in dark blue.  
The thin black lines seen in between degraders are the Nb, Cu, and Al activation points at each energy position, sealed in Kapton tape. 
The detail of each foil sealed in the Kapton is not visible here, simply due to the size scale of the stack assembly.

Using this MCNP6 model, the proton energy distribution is tallied in all volumes of the stack assembly.

In addition, the MCNP6 model tracks the production and transport of secondary neutrons produced through (p,xn) reactions on the target stack components.
The the proton energy distribution is tallied in all Al, Cu, and Nb foils, and is seen in \autoref{fig:ipf_ntallies}. 
The neutron flux is consistently 3--4 orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding proton flux, and is seen to be visibly  downscattered when moving down the stack.

Additionally, using this proton transport model, it is possible to plot the FWHM of the proton energy distribution in each of the Cu and Al monitor foils, as a function of its  flux-weighted average proton energy.
This is seen in \autoref{fig:ipf_FWHM_plot}.
As seen in the recent work of Graves \etal, this FWHM distribution can be fit via linear regression \cite{Graves2016}.
The results of this fit (with $R^2=0.9986$) would suggest that the broadening of proton energy distribution in the target stack is linearly proportional to energy degradation, which is overwhelmingly from the aluminum degraders between energy positions.
% , displaying a clear linear relationship  .
This serves to build confidence, through consistency with the  results from this similar measurement.
In the event that the FWHM of a stack element could not be directly calculated using the MCNP model output, this linear model could be used to estimate the element's FWHM through interpolation.

% \subsubsection{\ce{^{22,24}Na} production}
% 
% As discussed in \autoref{sec:proton_transport}, the observation of the \ce{^{22,24}Na} activities in Cu and Nb foils  represents an indirect measurement of the \ce{^{nat}Si}(p,x)\ce{^{22,24}Na} cross sections, but  was not  reported in the journal article due to 
% % the number of assumptions involved in such a calculation.
% uncertainties in the areal density of the Si in the adhesive.
% The EoB \ce{^{22,24}Na} activities have been measured directly, but to convert these into absolute cross sections, accurate knowledge of the precise silicone composition and areal density are required.
% These have been taken as  a 10\% Si stoichiometric basis and an areal density of 4.79\,mg/cm$^2$ (based on bulk density),
% respectively, for the purposes of transport calculations, but this level of confidence is insufficient for the reporting of a cross section.
% Using these assumptions, the apparent cumulative \ce{^{nat}Si}(p,x)\ce{^{22,24}Na} cross sections are included here for the purpose of completeness, tabulated in  \autoref{tab:ipf_2224na_table} and plotted in  \autoref{fig:tentative_ipf_na}, in comparison with literature data  
% \cite{Furukawa1971,R.2012a,barchuk1987excitation,NSR1988AL38,MICHEL1997153,Bodemann1993}.
% 
% 
% 
% % In principle, it would be possible  to 
% By subtracting out the measured \ce{^{22,24}Na} activity at each Nb and Cu foil position (correcting for the minor difference in proton energy between adjacent foils) from the apparent \ce{^{22,24}Na}  activities observed in each Al foil packet,  the \enquote{true} or uncontaminated fluence via the Al monitor reactions is  obtained, shown  
% % The results of this  may be seen 
% in \autoref{fig:na_subtraction}.
% Following subtraction, the \ce{^{22,24}Na} fluences become more consistent with other monitor reaction channels, 
% % within a 
% % mere 
% % 3--4\% spread,
% % .
% % Even following subtraction, 
% though  \ce{^{22}Na} fluence remains 3--6\% higher than the weighted mean of the remaining monitor reaction channels.
% While this would circumvent the assumptions needed for reporting \ce{^{nat}Si}(p,x)\ce{^{22,24}Na} cross sections, subtraction of  inaccurately quantified \ce{^{22,24}Na} activity in each Nb and Cu foil would propagate into the final fluence determination at each energy position, shifting the magnitude of all reported cross sections.
% While the dramatic improvement in monitor reaction consistency builds confidence, in the interest of surety and because they are consistent, only the \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{56}Co}, \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{62}Zn}, and \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{65}Zn} monitor reaction channels will be used for fluence determination for the reported cross sections.
% % In both cases, this disparity is caused by the fact that both of these monitor reactions may also form the \ce{^{22}Na} and \ce{^{56}Co} reaction products through contamination by secondary neutron (n,x) channels, increasing the apparent fluence as observed by these monitor reactions.
% % Since no method for reliably separating the fraction of \ce{^{22}Na} and \ce{^{56}Co} activities induced through (n,x) exists, the fluences predicted by these monitor channels are not used in the final determination of the proton fluence seen by Nb foils. 
% % The fact that this \enquote{extra fluence} diminishes at lower energy is likely attributed to the fact that the \ce{^{nat}Al}(p,x)\ce{^{22}Na} and \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{56}Co} have energetic thresholds of 23.35 and 36.76 MeV, respectively. 
% % The fraction of secondary neutrons produced by (p,xn)  which are energetic enough to populate the  \ce{^{22}Na} and \ce{^{56}Co} reaction products at the lower energy positions becomes progressively smaller.
% This serves as a pointed example of the importance of selecting monitor reaction products inaccessible through channels aside from the primary reaction (\ce{^{nat}Al}(p,x)\ce{^{22,24}Na}, in this case), as noted previously.
% % However,  the fact that both monitor reactions measure consistently higher fluence than the other channels on each foil builds confidence that the monitor reactions accurately indicate the presence of a non-negligible secondary neutron flux.

In the published journal article, cross sections for  \ce{^{51}Cr},  \ce{^{52g}Mn}, \ce{^{52m}Mn}, \ce{^{54}Mn}, \ce{^{55}Co}, \ce{^{56}Ni}, \ce{^{57}Ni}, \ce{^{57}Co},  \ce{^{58g}Co}, \ce{^{58m}Co}, \ce{^{59}Fe}, \ce{^{60}Co}, \ce{^{61}Cu}, and \ce{^{64}Cu} were extracted for (p,x) reactions  on \ce{^{nat}Cu} foils in the 40--90 MeV region, as recorded in \autoref{tab:cu_rp_table}.
For  (p,x) reactions on \ce{^{nat}Nb} foils, the (p,x) cross sections for \ce{^{82m}Rb}, \ce{^{83}Sr}, \ce{^{85g}Y}, \ce{^{85m}Y}, \ce{^{86}Zr}, \ce{^{86}Y}, \ce{^{87}Zr}, \ce{^{87g}Y}, \ce{^{87m}Y}, \ce{^{88}Zr}, \ce{^{88}Y}, \ce{^{89g}Nb}, \ce{^{89m}Nb}, \ce{^{89}Zr}, \ce{^{90}Mo}, \ce{^{90}Nb}, \ce{^{91m}Nb}, \ce{^{92m}Nb}, and \ce{^{93m}Mo} were extracted, as recorded in \autoref{tab:nb_rp_table}.
As an alternative to a simple list of the various observed reaction products, these may be visualized in \autoref{fig:ipf_nb_product_table} and \autoref{fig:ipf_cu_product_table}, in the style of excerpts from the Chart of  Nuclides.
These figures display the target and compound nuclei  for both  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) and \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x), along with all observed reaction products, to illustrate the mass range probed in this measurement.

\ce{^{57}Ni} ($t_{1/2}=35.60\pm0.06$ h, $\epsilon$=100\% to \ce{^{57}Co} \cite{Bhat1998}), while useful on its own as a positron emitter, stands poised as a particularly promising candidate for theranostic pairing with the soft $\beta^-$ emitter \ce{^{66}Ni} ($t_{1/2}=54.6\pm0.3$ h, $\beta^-$=100\% to \ce{^{66}Cu} \cite{Browne2010a}) \cite{PMID:7632762,zweit1996medium,Graves2016,Rosch2014}. 
\ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{57}Ni} would seem to be an intriguing production pathway, due to the ready availability of Cu metal as target, combined with the fact that production in this pathway strongly favors \ce{^{57}Ni} over \ce{^{56}Ni} --- indeed, the \ce{^{57}Ni}/\ce{^{56}Ni} 
%ratio of cross sections is approximately 70 at 61.58 MeV, and varies from 11-18 at the 70-90 MeV positions.
ratio of production rates is approximately 290 at 61.58 MeV, and varies from 45--75 at the 70--90 MeV positions.
The traditional route for \ce{^{57}Ni} production is via \ce{^{nat}Co}(p,3n)\ce{^{57}Ni}, but at moderate energies, suffers from more  \ce{^{56}Ni} contamination than \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)  ($\sigma_\text{57Ni} / \sigma_\text{56Ni}\approx$ 10 at maximum).
Lower-energy production via \ce{^{nat}Co}(p,3n) at 24--40\,MeV is below threshold for \ce{^{56}Ni}, but has a peak cross section of approximately 10 mb, making \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x) the superior production route for moderate-energy accelerators  \cite{MICHEL1997153,Ditrói2013}.


% Moving away from the potential PET emitters, 
\ce{^{64}Cu}  ($t_{1/2}$ = 12.7 h) undergoes $\beta^+$ decay (61.5\% branching ratio) to \ce{^{64}Ni} or $\beta^-$ decay (38.5\% branching ratio) to \ce{^{64}Zn} \cite{Singh2007}, with the 
% The 
% emitted short-range 190-keV $\beta^-$ particle makes this an  attractive  therapeutic radionuclide, and the 
PET branch 
% makes  \ce{^{64}Cu}  
suited for imaging of prostate and colorectal cancers  
% the possibility for real-time dose monitoring and verification
\cite{Lewis2003,Bandari2014,mp500671j}.
% This makes \ce{^{64}Cu} particularly desirable  for emerging radiation therapy protocols \cite{Lewis2003,Bandari2014,mp500671j}.
Several production routes currently exist: \ce{^{64}Ni}(p,n)  uses 8--14 MeV protons on the expensive enriched target \ce{^{64}Ni} (0.9255\% natural abundance), but offers a high radioisotopic purity assuming a highly enriched target \cite{Szelecsenyi1993,Aslam2009}.
\ce{^{68}Zn}(p,$\alpha$n) requires more energetic 20--30 MeV protons, and necessitates an enriched target (18.45\% natural abundance) to avoid the co-production of radio-copper impurities \cite{Hilgers2003,Szelecsenyi2005}.
More recently, the use of compact DD neutron generators for \ce{^{nat}Zn}(n,p) production has been proposed, with the promise of mCi-scale production with high specific activity  \cite{Voyles2017}.
% \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{64}Cu} could be another potential production pathway 



\ce{^{86}Y} ($t_{1/2}=14.74\pm0.02$ h, $\epsilon$=100\% to \ce{^{86}Sr}  \cite{NEGRET20151}) is another novel  emerging  PET isotope, whose longer half-life has poised it for applications as a tracer for slower metabolic processes, as well as in   pharmacokinetics studies \cite{Valdovinos2017,Nickles2003,Qaim2008,QaimSyedM2011}.
In particular, it is highly desired to form a theranostic pair with the widely-employed $\beta^-$ therapy agent \ce{^{90}Y} ($t_{1/2}=64.00\pm0.21$ h, $\beta^-$=100\% to \ce{^{90}Zr} \cite{Browne1997}), which can be produced from a long-lived \ce{^{90}Sr} generator and emits no discrete observable gamma-rays or x-rays though decay \cite{Herzog1993}.
Although a weak positron branch exists and bremsstrahlung scintigraphy is commonly used for clinical imaging of the \ce{^{90}Y} biodistribution, theranostics  necessitate an imaging isotope to be paired for quantification of its uptake and biodistribution  \cite{Nickles2004}.
Conventional production of \ce{^{86}Y} proceeds through low-energy (7--14 MeV) irradiation via \ce{^{86}Sr}(p,n), which requires an enriched  \ce{^{86}Sr} target (9.86\% natural abundance), in order to eliminate contamination from (p,n) on the other stable \ce{^{84,87,88}Sr} isotopes  \cite{Rosch1993}.
Alternatively, production at 33--43 MeV via \ce{^{88}Sr}(p,3n) has been proposed --- this pathway also requires an enriched target (82.58\% natural abundance) for the same reason, but contamination with other Y co-activities will be even more pronounced than via (p,n), due to the opening of (p,n) and (p,2n) channels on all stable Sr isotopes \cite{doi:10.1139/v67-193,levkovski1991cross}.
Minimizing activity from other isotopes of the element in question is essential for producing radionuclides in high specific activity, as these competing isotopes are often impractical to separate out by radiochemical means.
% \comment{Stephen:  impossible by radiochemical means, and impossible by affordable/practical means.\\Substitute for ``difficult'' post-discussion.}
As a result, it would appear that \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) is a poor route for  \ce{^{86}Y} production in this respect, as it only reaches a maximum of approximately 35\% radioisotopic purity.
The  dominant yttrium radioisotope produced by  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) in the 40--90 MeV region is  \ce{^{87}Y} ($t_{1/2}=79.8\pm0.3$ h, $\epsilon^-$=100\% to \ce{^{87m}Sr} \cite{Johnson2015}).
However,  \ce{^{87}Y} itself has application as a generator for  \ce{^{87m}Sr} ($t_{1/2}=2.815\pm0.012$ h, IT=99.70\% to \ce{^{87}Sr} \cite{Johnson2015}), which is used for imaging studies of metastatic bone cancers, especially when in a theranostic pair with the established therapy agent \ce{^{89}Sr} ($t_{1/2}=50.563\pm0.0025$ d, $\beta^-$=100\% to \ce{^{89}Y} \cite{Singh2013}) \cite{Kiselev1974,Kandil2009}.
% Since the radio-yttrium purity of \ce{^{87}Y} is approximately 88\% between 51--61 MeV in \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x), this could present an intriguing route for  \ce{^{87}Y} production.




\ce{^{89}Zr} ($t_{1/2}=78.41\pm0.12$ h, $\epsilon$=100\% to \ce{^{89}Y}  \cite{Singh2013}) is a long-lived positron emitter useful as a tracer for slow biological processes, immune studies, and imaging of liver and  breast cancers \cite{Verel2003,Dijkers2009,Dijkers2010}.
Current production focuses on \ce{^{89}Y}(p,n)\ce{^{89}Zr} between 9--14 MeV, which offers an extremely high-purity route on a mono-isotopic target and a strong population of \ce{^{89}Zr}, with a peak cross section of nearly 800 mb   \cite{PhysRevC.38.1624,Omara2009}.
Due to co-production of additional \ce{^{86,87,88}Zr} radio-zirconium,  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) is clearly inferior to  \ce{^{89}Y}(p,n)\ce{^{89}Zr}, as the Nb route has a smaller peak cross section of approximately 290 mb, and achieves only 10--20\% radioisotopic purity in the 50--90 MeV region.




\ce{^{90}Nb} ($t_{1/2}=14.60 \pm 0.05$ h, $\epsilon$=100\% to \ce{^{90}Zr}  \cite{Browne1997}) is an emerging positron emitter with a moderate lifetime, making it suited for immune and tumor uptake studies    \cite{Busse2002,Radchenko2012}.
It is typically produced using 8--15 MeV protons via \ce{^{90}Zr}(p,n)\ce{^{90}Nb}, using an enriched target (51.45\% natural abundance) for high radioisotopic purity, and produces a product with minimal contamination and a peak cross section of approximately 750 mb  \cite{Busse2002}.
\ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x)\ce{^{90}Nb} offers a possible alternative pathway using a natural target, at the expense of a smaller peak cross section.
\ce{^{90}Nb} may be produced directly with an approximately 370 mb peak cross section and 99\% radioisotopic purity, or could be produced as a \ce{^{90}Mo}/\ce{^{90}Nb} generator, which would have nearly 100\% radioisotopic purity by using protons below the \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,5n) threshold of 45.76 MeV.
However, the greatest problem with using the \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) reaction to produce \ce{^{90}Nb} is the inability to separate the radioisotope from the target itself, rendering the production of a high-specific activity product impossible.  







Finally, \ce{^{82\text{m}}Rb} ($t_{1/2}=6.472\pm0.006$ h, $\epsilon$=100\% to \ce{^{82}Kr}  \cite{Tuli2003}) is a diagnostic and emerging Auger-therapy agent, typically seen as a contaminant in \ce{^{82}Sr}/\ce{^{82}Rb} generators 
% for PET studies
\cite{Kovacs1991}.
It is commonly produced via \ce{^{82}Kr}(p,n) at 10--15 MeV, using an enriched \ce{^{82}Kr} gaseous target, with a peak cross section of approximately 400 mb at 12 MeV \cite{Kovacs1991}.
Production via \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) offers the use of metallic, natural abundance targetry, but requires significantly higher energy (\textgreater 80 MeV) protons, peaking at approximately 20 mb near 600 MeV \cite{Titarenko2011}.
It is clear that this production route offers no advantage over existing \ce{^{82}Kr}(p,n) routes for in-house production.
